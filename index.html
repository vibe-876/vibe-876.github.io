Hello, my name's Cam.
I'm a student at Aberystwyth University interested in (among other things)
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Programming</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Literature</li>
<li>Brewing</li>
</ul>

<p>
With programming, I mainly use GNU Emacs &#x2013; I don't really like the idea of a favourite language, but I mainly use and enjoy Haskell, misc lisps, and C.
I also don't really subscribe to a single paradigm either.
OOP can be elegant for certain problems (though I am yet to find an OOP language that I can really find elegant, I'd like to try Smalltalk at some point), functional for others, logic for others, it's the horse for the course.
Some of the programming that I do I put up on <a href="https://github.com/vibe-876">my Github</a>, though most of it stays on my local machine.
</p>

<p>
On the mathematical side, I'm obsessed with mathematical analysis and graph theory.
Similarly to my opinions on programming languages, I don't really like the divide between pure and applied maths either, it's more about how you approach the problem.
I feel like everything is either applied, or will be at some point: if category theory can find applications, anything can.
</p>

<p>
This website is written in org mode, with some CSS on the side, because I don't like writing HTML.
</p>

<p>
If for some reason you want to read about the various things that I do, I have <a href="blog.html">a blog</a>!
</p>

<p>
Some of my friends have websites too (all better than this one), and I think you should check them all out :) .

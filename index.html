      <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Cam. I'm a computer science and mathematics student at Aberystwyth University. I'm interested in quite a few things. On the mathematical side, I'm particularly interested in real analysis, type theory, graph theory, and abstract algebra. On the more computational side, I like the formal verification of programs, algorithm and data structure design and analysis, and programming language theory. I also enjoy programming, which I mainly do using Clojure, Emacs Lisp, Haskell, and C. I'm also learning (and enjoying) Lean 4.</p>

      <p>I also really enjoy reading. Some of my favourites include Blood Meridian, The Lord of the Rings (as well as The Hobbit and The Silmarillion), No Longer Human, and basically anything by Kazuo Ishiguro. I also read a lot of Stephen King, with my current favourite being Pet Sematary.</p>

      <p>A few of the programs I write end up on <a href="https://github.com/vibe-876">my Github</a>, although there's nothing noteworthy on there to date. If you for some reason want to contact me, contact details are available there.</p>
